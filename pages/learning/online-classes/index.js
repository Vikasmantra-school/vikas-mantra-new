                  has resulted in the closure of educational institutions across
                  the country. Since the traditional classroom learning can be
                  unsafe for the teachers and students, we have come up with a
                  quick fix of seeking assistance through online learning
                  platforms. These are the tough times, not only for the students
                  but also for people all over the world. The struggle is real
                  mentally and economically, however when it comes to students,
                  they are attempting to understand the reality of accepting the
                  new normal of not being able to go out, not getting to meet
                  their friends and to cope with the changed routine.

                <p className='AnimeElement'>
                  At the same time, it is imperative for the institution to
                  address the educational needs of the students. In Vikas mantra
                  public school, we are determined to transcend beyond the
                  classroom learning to e-learning platforms. When the technology
                  is employed in the right manner, the advantages of online
                  learning know no bound. In VMPS we are making sure that the
                  teachers are familiarized with utilizing the digital platforms
                  to teach and monitor the student’s academic performance.

                  In VMPS, we are now proudly delivering quality education through
                  the medium of technology to all of our students. Some of the
                  digital platforms which have been employed by our institution
                  are zoom for video communication between the students and the
                  teachers, Google classroom for sharing of information’s,
                  worksheets/assignments and feedback with the students and lively
                  virtual tools like quizzes/ videos for better understand of the
                  concepts.

                <p className='AnimeElement'>
                  For the kindergarteners, we are uploading recorded video lessons
                  and worksheet regularly in the Google classroom for the
                  convenience of the students. And for the primary and middle
                  class students we are providing zoom classes everyday as well as
                  the materials/ assignments are posted in the Google classroom.
                  Furthermore we are routinely uploading co-scholastic video
                  lessons (music, yoga, dance, art and craft and physical
                  education) in the Google classroom to keep them engaged and to
                  improve their fine and gross motor skills during the period of
                  lockdown at home.

                  With the extending lockdown and the closure of school can
                  indefinitely turn over the lives of the students, so it is
                  crucial for us as an institution to deliver our best service and
                  support towards our students.
