//                                 <p className='AnimeElement'>According to research, every child is born with the ability to learn. But in the majority of cases, kids (and even adults) have a particular, individual learning style that changes throughout the course of their lives. A youngster can continue to learn in many different ways, but he or she will often favor one learning method over the others. For instance, whereas you might be able to spell a word just by seeing it, your child might not be able to recall the spelling of some words unless he or she first writes them down word by word to spell them. Yet, there is no such thing as a good or bad learning style in general. It&apos;s important to remember that parents&apos; techniques for determining primary learning styles may be very different from those of your child or even from those of other people. In the models listed below, determine your child&apos;s preferred method of learning.

//                                 <p className='AnimeElement'>Despite being multi-talented, a vast majority of today’s children feel lonely, get quickly bored, isolate themselves, and lack curiosity and satisfaction. Most of the time, they either find themselves highly stressed and anxious or sad and depressed.</p>

//                                 <p className='AnimeElement'>There is no doubt that technology and the latest innovation have provided many opportunities, regardless of the age group. But these have also made us disconnect from ourselves, snatching our natural ability to take time, ponder, introspect, and respond mindfully.</p>

//                                 <p className='AnimeElement'>Now the most important question is, how and where should children strike the right balance? How do they learn to stay connected to their inner self while maintaining a sense of awareness of everything going on around them? This is where Yoga comes into the picture. Today, Yoga is recognized and practiced all over the world. Almost everyone knows the significance of practicing yoga, i.e., it not only looks after one’s physical health but also fosters emotional, mental, and spiritual well-being.</p>
