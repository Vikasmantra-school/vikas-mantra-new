                  At Vikas Mantra Public School, we believe that celebrations
                  are more than just festive occasions—they are essential to
                  building a joyful, inclusive, and dynamic learning
                  environment. While academics form the foundation of education,
                  it&apos;s through celebrations that students truly connect, grow,
                  and experience the richness of life beyond the classroom.

                  Every celebration at VMPS is a beautiful reflection of our
                  culturally rich and diverse school community. These events
                  offer students the chance to actively participate in
                  traditions from different backgrounds, deepening their
                  understanding and respect for others. Whether it&apos;s a festival,
                  a national holiday, or a school-specific event, each
                  celebration becomes a bridge that brings cultures together and
